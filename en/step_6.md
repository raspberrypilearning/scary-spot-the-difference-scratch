* You could add a countdown timer so that your friend will concentrate **really hard** to spot the differences before the time runs out!
* You could add a fake score. Perhaps you could then set up the game so that the zombie doesn't appear until your friend has clicked on at least three differences.
* If you would like to try to program a similar prank in Python, have a look at [rpf.io/scare](https://rpf.io/scare){:target="_blank"}.
