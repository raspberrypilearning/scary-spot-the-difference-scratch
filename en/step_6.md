* Perhaps you could add a countdown timer so your friend will concentrate **really hard** trying to spot the differences before the time runs out?
* Can you keep a fake score of differences spotted before the scary picture is displayed? Maybe the zombie doesn't appear until they have clicked on at least three differences.
* If you'd like to have a go at programming a similar prank using Python, then have a look at [rpf.io/scare](https://rpf.io/scare){:target="_blank"}.
