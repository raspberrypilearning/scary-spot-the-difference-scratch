## What next?

* To make the scare even more unpredictable, can you set the length of time between the game starting and the scary picture appearing to be a random number of seconds?
* Can you keep a fake score of differences spotted before the scary picture is displayed?
* Perhaps you could add a countdown timer so your friend will concentrate **really hard** trying to spot the differences before the time runs out?
