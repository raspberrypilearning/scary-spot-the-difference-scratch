## Making the scary picture appear

Now it's time to add the code to make your prank work!

- When the program starts, you want the page with the fake instructions to display. Click on the Scripts tab to add your code. The `switch backdrop` block from Looks can be used to control which backdrop is showing.

2. When the player clicks on the screen to start the game, the Spot the Difference picture should appear. Give them some time to look for the differences, then switch to the scary picture backdrop to give them a fright!

	Can you work out how to finish off the code below to make this work?
