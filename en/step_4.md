## Gathering the assets

- You're going to need two images and a sound file for this activity. Firstly, you'll need a Spot the Difference image. This one is free to use, but you can make or find your own if you prefer.

	If you would like to use this image, right-click on it and save it onto your computer.

2. Next, you'll need the image you're going to swap with the game image to give the player a fright. This zombie face is cool, but you can make or find your own if you like. Just remember the age of the people you're trying to scare and choose something appropriate.

3. Lastly, you'll need a scary sound to really give them a shock. You could download [this one](http://soundbible.com/1627-Female-Scream-Horror.html). Alternatively, you could use a sound from the Scratch library, or perhaps if you have a microphone you could record your own scary sound. Muhahahaha!
